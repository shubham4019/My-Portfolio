<p style="font-size: 46">The group project which I once did involved the use of solar energy. We created a tunnel in which the lights at the ceiling used the solar energy to light up. The team worked hard for the project. There were some troubles when the project was going smoothly, but they were solved. At the exhibition we all took turns to explain the benefits of using the solar energy.</p>
